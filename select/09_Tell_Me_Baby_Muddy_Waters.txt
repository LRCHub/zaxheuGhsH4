My friends told me and I thought it was a joke
Whoa, there is fire, baby, have a lot of smoke
Tell me, baby, how many times?

Curl up and tell me, tell me the truth
Did I see you last night, baby, in that telephone booth?
Tell me, baby, how many times?

I saw you last night out with old Jim
He wasn't kissin' you, baby, I declare you was kissin' him
Tell me, baby, mm darlin', how many times?

Paramore "Running Out Of Time' Official Lyrics & Meaning | Verified
I came home this morning about half past four
I know I heard someone wailing on my back door
Tell me, baby, oh tell me, darling, how many times?

Tell me, oh tell me quick
Before I get mad, baby, for??
Tell me, baby, oh darling, how many times?
