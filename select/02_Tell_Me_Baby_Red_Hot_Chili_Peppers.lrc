[00:28.21] They come from every state to find
[00:30.52] Some dreams were meant to be declined
[00:32.79] Tell the man what did you have in mind
[00:34.97] What have you come to do?
[00:47.47] 
[00:37.25] No turning water into wine
[00:39.34] No learning while you're in the line
[00:41.71] I'll take you to the broken sign
[00:44.05] You see these lights are blue
[00:58.55] 
[00:46.10] Come and get it, lost it at the city limit
[00:48.28] Say goodbye 'cause they will find a way to trim it
[00:50.56] Everybody looking for a silly gimmick
[00:52.68] Gotta get away, can't take it for another minute
[01:16.68] 
[00:55.04] This town is made of many things
[00:57.38] Just look at what the current brings
[00:59.42] So high it's only promising
[01:01.65] This place was made on you
[01:14.65] 
[01:04.06] Tell me baby, what's your story
[01:08.21] Where you come from
[01:10.55] And where you want to go this time, aw
[01:13.15] Oh, tell me lover
[01:15.23] Are you lonely?
[01:17.39] The thing we need is never all that hard to find, aw
[01:43.39] 
[01:21.94] Tell me baby, what's your story
[01:26.29] Where do you come from
[01:28.22] And where you want to go this time, aw
[01:30.94] Oh, you're so lovely
[01:33.08] Are you lonely?
[01:35.25] Or giving up on the innocence you left behind
[01:57.75] 
[01:50.53] Some claim to have the fortitude
[01:52.83] Too shrewd to blow the interlude
[01:55.18] Sustaining pain to set a mood
[01:57.35] Step out to be renewed
[02:08.35] 
[01:59.55] I'll move you like a baritone
[02:01.77] Jungle brothers on the microphone
[02:03.92] Getting over with an undertone
[02:06.21] It's time to turn to stone
[02:19.21] 
[02:08.21] Chitty chitty baby when your nose is in the nitty gritty
[02:10.54] Life could be a little sweet
[02:11.86] But life could be a little shitty
[02:12.92] What a pity, Boston and a Kansas City
[02:14.83] Lookin' for a hundred but you only ever found a fitty
[02:41.33] 
[02:17.23] Three fingers in the honeycomb
[02:19.61] You ring just like a xylophone
[02:21.77] Devoted to the chromosome
[02:23.93] The day that you left home
[02:36.93] 
[02:26.33] Tell me baby, what's your story
[02:30.64] Where you come from
[02:32.69] And where you want to go this time, aw
[02:35.35] Oh, tell me lover
[02:37.59] Are you lonely?
[02:39.75] The thing we need is never all that hard to find, aw
[03:05.75] 
[02:44.19] Tell me baby, what's your story
[02:48.47] Where do you come from
[02:50.48] And where you want to go this time, aw
[02:53.18] Oh, you're so lovely
[02:55.20] Are you lonely?
[02:57.43] Or giving up on the innocence you left behind
[03:19.93] 
[03:21.67] Tell me baby, what's your story
[03:25.96] Where you come from
[03:27.86] And where you want to go this time, aw
[03:30.61] Oh, tell me lover
[03:32.74] Are you lonely?
[03:34.92] The thing we need is never all that hard to find, aw
[04:00.92] 
[03:39.37] Tell me baby, what's your story
[03:43.71] Where do you come from
[03:45.65] And where you want to go this time, aw
[03:48.38] Oh, you're so lovely
[03:50.53] Are you lonely?
[03:52.79] Or giving up on the innocence you left behind
